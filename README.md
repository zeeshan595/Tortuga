# tortuga-library

Tortuga is a open source Game Engine built in C++ 17. Tortuga ONLY uses vulkan for its graphics API with NO plans of using any other graphics API. Tortuga is built for linux but should be compatible on Mac OS X and Windows. For editing the source code & building the project a copy of `vs code` or `gnome-builder` is recomended.

**Key Features**

* Multi-Threaded Rendering
* Data Oriented Design
* Entity Component System
